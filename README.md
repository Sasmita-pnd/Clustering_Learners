# Clustering_Learners
### Introduction
Scaler is an online tech-versity offering intensive computer science & Data Science courses through live classes delivered by tech leaders and subject matter experts. The meticulously structured program enhances the skills of software professionals by offering a modern curriculum with exposure to the latest technologies.

●A significant challenge for Scaler is understanding the diverse backgrounds of its learners, especially in terms of their current roles, companies, and experience.

●Clustering similar learners helps in customizing the learning experience, thereby increasing retention and satisfaction.

● Analyzing the vast data of learners can uncover patterns in their professional backgrounds and preferences. This allows Scaler to make tailored content recommendations and provide specialized mentorship.

● By leveraging data science and unsupervised learning, particularly clustering techniques, Scaler can group learners with similar profiles, aiding in delivering a more personalized learning journey.

### Objective
Analyzing the dataset to profile the best companies and job positions from Scaler's database. The primary goal is to execute clustering techniques, evaluate the coherence of the clusters, and provide actionable insights for enhanced learner profiling and course tailoring.

### Techniques Used 
**EDA**

**Data Wrangling**
*   Null values check, Feature Engineering, Handling Duplicates, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Mining, Outlier Detection and Removal

  #### Data Visualisation
*  Univariate Analysis(distplot,kdeplot,countplot)
*  Bivariate Analysis(boxplot, barplot, lineplot)

 #### Model
Hopkins Statistics, Elbow Method, k-means Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering

### Results
Got 6 Clusters using k-means and 5 clusters using agglomerative.

Clusters using k-means and clusters using agglomerative clustering are very similar and coherent.
